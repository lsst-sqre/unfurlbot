### Bug fixes

- Make `description` optional in the JiraIssueSummmary model. Rubin epics typically do not have descriptions in the same manner as regular issues. Since we don't use the description field in the unfurl, we can safely make it optional.
- Updated `ProcessContext` to call `aclose` rather than `close` on the Redis client.
