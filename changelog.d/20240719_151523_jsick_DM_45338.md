### Bug fixes

- Make `description` optional in the JiraIssueSummmary model. Rubin epics typically do not have descriptions in the same manner as regular issues. Since we don't use the description field in the unfurl, we can safely make it optional.
- Normalize dates in the JiraIssueSummary so that they are consistently converted to the UTC timezone.
- Updated `ProcessContext` to call `aclose` rather than `close` on the Redis client.
